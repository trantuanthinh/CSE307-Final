                    Before the invention of the piano, there were keyboard
                    instruments like the harpsichord and clavichord. These
                    instruments produced sound by plucking strings (harpsichord)
                    or striking them with small metal blades (clavichord).

                    The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori, an Italian
                    instrument maker, around the year 1700. Cristofori's early
                    pianos were known as "gravicembalo col piano e forte,"
                    allowing volume control based on key strike force.

                    The piano gained popularity in the 18th century, with
                    builders like Johann Andreas Stein contributing to its
                    evolution. The range expanded, and structural and tonal
                    refinements occurred.
