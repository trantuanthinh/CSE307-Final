        <h1>History of the Piano</h1>

        <p><strong>1. Harpsichord and Clavichord (predecessors):</strong></p>
        <p>
            Before the invention of the piano, there were keyboard instruments
            like the harpsichord and clavichord. These instruments produced
            sound by plucking strings (harpsichord) or striking them with small
            metal blades (clavichord).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong
                >2. Bartolomeo Cristofori's Invention (Early 18th
                Century):</strong
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori, an Italian
            instrument maker, around the year 1700. Cristofori's early pianos
            were known as "gravicembalo col piano e forte," allowing volume
            control based on key strike force.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Spread and Evolution in the 18th Century:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The piano gained popularity in the 18th century, with builders like
            Johann Andreas Stein contributing to its evolution. The range
            expanded, and structural and tonal refinements occurred.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. 19th Century Innovations:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The 19th century saw significant improvements in piano design with
            metal frames and cross-stringing. The instrument became a staple in
            classical and popular music.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Rise of Piano Manufacturing:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Piano manufacturing became a significant industry in the 19th
            century, producing various styles like grand and upright pianos.
        </p>

        <p><strong>6. 20th Century and Beyond:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The 20th century brought further refinements, including electric and
            digital pianos with new possibilities in sound and portability. The
            piano remains a central instrument in various music genres.
