                    The guitar's origins can be traced back to ancient stringed
                    instruments such as the lute and oud. These early
                    instruments had a rounded body and a varying number of
                    strings.

                    During the Renaissance, the guitar evolved with the addition
                    of frets and a standardized number of strings. In the
                    Baroque era, the guitar gained popularity as a solo
                    instrument, and notable composers wrote music specifically
                    for it.

                    In the 19th century, Antonio Torres developed the design of
                    the classical guitar, introducing features like the
                    fan-bracing system. The classical guitar became a standard
                    instrument in classical music, known for its nylon strings
                    and distinctive sound.

                    In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the steel-string
                    acoustic guitar gained popularity, especially in folk,
                    blues, and country music. Companies like Martin and Gibson
                    played a crucial role in popularizing the steel-string

                    The invention of the electric guitar in the 1930s, notably
                    by pioneers like Adolph Rickenbacker and Les Paul,
                    revolutionized music. The electric guitar's ability to
                    produce amplified sound led to the emergence of rock and
                    roll and various other genres.

                    that shaped the sound of modern music. Innovations like the
                    whammy bar and the introduction of various pickups further
                    expanded the possibilities of the electric guitar.
