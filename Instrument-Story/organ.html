        <h1>History of the Organ</h1>

        <p><strong>1. Ancient Organs:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The origins of the organ can be traced back to ancient
            civilizations, where various cultures had simple wind instruments.
            The ancient Greeks and Romans had hydraulis, an early type of pipe
            organ powered by water.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Medieval and Renaissance Organs:</strong></p>
        <p>
            During the medieval period, the organ evolved, and bellows began to
            replace water as a source of wind. In the Renaissance, organs became
            more sophisticated with the addition of stops and multiple
            keyboards.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Baroque Organ Development:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The Baroque era saw significant advancements in organ design and
            construction. Builders like Arp Schnitger and Gottfried Silbermann
            created organs with powerful sounds and expressive capabilities. The
            development of the pedalboard allowed organists to play bass notes
            with their feet.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. Classical and Romantic Organs:</strong></p>
        <p>
            In the Classical era, organ design became more standardized, and
            organs were built to suit the musical style of the time. The
            Romantic era brought about larger and more elaborate organs with
            increased tonal variety and expression.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Electric and Electronic Organs:</strong></p>
        <p>
            In the 20th century, electric and electronic organs were developed,
            providing new possibilities in terms of portability and sound
            synthesis. Hammond organs, for example, became popular in jazz and
            popular music.
        </p>

        <p><strong>6. Contemporary Organs:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Modern organs often combine traditional pipe organ elements with
            electronic components. Digital organs have gained popularity,
            offering versatility and programmable features. Pipe organs are
            still built, with some contemporary builders incorporating
            innovative designs.
