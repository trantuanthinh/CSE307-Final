                    The ukulele's roots can be traced back to a small
                    guitar-like instrument called the machete brought to Hawaii
                    by Portuguese immigrants in the 19th century.

                    Hawaiians embraced the machete, and it underwent
                    adaptations, including changes to its size, shape, and the
                    addition of gut strings. The name "ukulele" roughly
                    translates to "jumping flea" in Hawaiian, possibly referring
                    to the quick finger movements of players.
